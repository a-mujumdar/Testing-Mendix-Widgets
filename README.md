# Mendix low code platform

Low-code development is a way to build apps more quickly by reducing the need to code. Digital transformation is a critical success factor for modern business. Low-code development enables IT to innovate faster. Build more in less time. And drive the business through its digital transformation. Low-code describes a family of tools that helps developers create complete applications visually using a drag-and-drop interface. Rather than writing thousands of lines of complex code and syntax, low-code platforms allow users to build complete applications with modern user interfaces, integrations, data and logic quickly and visually.

A typical low-code development platform has:

   --> An environment for visually defining the User Interface (UI).\
   --> Connectors to various back-ends or services.\
   --> Automated tools to build, debug, deploy, and maintain the application.

I created a microflow in Mendix platform to integrate Mendix with MS-SQL Database. Microflow is as shown below in the screenshot and it's a microflow to display EvenID and BitPos from MS-SQL database.
