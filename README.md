# Mendix platform

Apps can be created using Mendix. It is the front end for any back-end. 

I integrated Mendix with MS-SQL database as well as Oracle (Big-data lake). Tested data base connection functionality at the back-end by creating microflows and tested different widgets such as buttons, drop-down, date-time widget, navigation etc.. on the front-end webpage. 

It has:

   --> An environment for visually defining the User Interface (UI).\
   --> Connectors to various back-ends or services.\
   --> Automated tools to build, debug, deploy, and maintain the application.
   
This Mendix platform enables to build and continuously improve mobile and web applications at scale. The Mendix Platform is designed to accelerate enterprise app delivery across  entire application development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment and operations.
